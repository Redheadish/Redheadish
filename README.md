### Hi, Iâ€™m Dana Krasnoholovets â€” aspiring Python developer with a taste for clean code and small clever solutions.

I'm passionate about:
- Python development (CLI tools, automation, backend basics)
- Learning by building real, useful things
- Growing into a tech role where I can combine logic, elegance, and empathy

### ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently:
- Expanding my portfolio with small open-source projects
- Learning Git, REST APIs, Flask, and testing practices
- Exploring what it means to write good, thoughtful code

### âœ¨ Projects
- [To-Do CLI App](https://github.com/Redheadish/todo-cli-app): pure Python terminal app to manage tasks, save them in JSON, and interact via simple text commands.
- (more coming soon...)
